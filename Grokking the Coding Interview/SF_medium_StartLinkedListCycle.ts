// Start of LinkedList Cycle

// Given the head of a Singly LinkedList that contains a cycle, write a function to find the starting node of the cycle.

const find_cycle_start = function(head) {
  // use Floyds algorithm to find the start of the cycle
  // use slow and fast pointer to find a meeting point
  // the distance between the meeting point and cycle start
  // and start of the list and cycle start is equal
  // - use 2 pointers fast and slow to find a meeting point
  // - set start to the list start
  // - iterate start and end from meeting point
  // - when start will equal meeting point
  // - then end will equal cycle start

  // find meeting point
  let slow = head;
  let fast = head;
  let meetingPoint, start;
  while (meetingPoint == null) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next && fast.next.next;

    if (slow == fast) {
      meetingPoint = fast;
      slow = head;
    }
  }

  // f cycle start
  while (start != fast) {
    start = start.next;
    fast = fast.next;
  }

  return start;
}; // O(n) + O(n) === O(n); O(1)
